## Information
The game has the ability to randomly choose whether the AI starts the game or you (the player). When the AI makes its move, a [Minimax algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-1-introduction/) helps it choose its next move. 

## New
- Added [alpha beta pruning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-4-alpha-beta-pruning/) to the algorithm making it more efficient.
